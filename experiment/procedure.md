### Procedure
●	Assemble the apparatus and get a DC source with an attached ammeter.

●	Take a 250mL beaker and add 100mL of distilled water.

●	Further, slowly add 50mL of dilute (3M) Sulfuric acid to this solution.

●	Take the solution and pour into a 50mL burette and invert it into the solution. Use a ring stand, and a clamp to hold it in place.

●	Attach the copper wire cathode to the negative terminal of the DC source and place the other end uninsulted into the inverted mouth of the burette.

●	The anode electrode should be immersed in the acid solution and hung over the edge of the beaker, with the other end attached to the positive electrode of the DC source.

●	Turn on the DC source, then record the time and the ammeter reading.

●	Try to maintain a steady current throughout. If the current fluctuates during electrolysis, then use an average value.

●	Collect at least 20mL of hydrogen during the electrolysis.

●	Then note the time you ceased the process of electrolysis.
