### Theory
In this experiment, the value of faraday is determined by measuring the amount of charge required to reduce 1 mol of H+ ions, regarding the following reaction.
2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  + 2e<sup>-</sup>  → H<sub>2(g)</sub>  or  1H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  + 1e<sup>-</sup> → 1/2H<sub>2(g)</sub>.

The experimental value for faraday’s number can be determined through electrolysis of a copper wire. A coulometer (a standard electrolytic cell) determines the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are not in use anymore now constant current (I) sources are available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by:-

Q = It

Here, Q is in Columbus when I is in ampere and t is in second.
1C = 1A × 1s
We can measure the charge on the electron in coulombs and it is equal to 1.60 × 10-19 C.

2H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  + 2e<sup>-</sup>  → H<sub>2(g)</sub>  or  1H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>  + 1e<sup>-</sup> → 1/2H<sub>2(g)</sub>.


The above equation represents that 1 hydrogen ion reduced for every electron passed through the solution and that one molecule of H2 produced for every 2 electrons. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis equals the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. The product of electrolysis depends on the following factors:

Nature of the materials being electrolysed.
Types of electrodes being used.
Kinetic barrier and over voltage.
Cathodic reactions.
Anodic Reactions.
Unexpected products because of overvoltage.
